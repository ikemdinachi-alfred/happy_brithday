            <p>
                Heavenly Father, <br>
                I thank You for the gift of a sweetheart in my life. Today, as she celebrates her birthday, I come before You with a heart full of gratitude for this incredible woman You have blessed me with. <br><br>
                Lord, I ask that You pour out Your abundant blessings upon her. May her life be filled with unending joy, good health, and peace that surpasses all understanding. May her dreams and aspirations align with Your perfect plan, and may she flourish in every area of her life. <br><br>
                Father, I pray that You surround her with love and favor in everything she does. Protect her, guide her, and strengthen her as she walks through life. Let her days be filled with happiness, her nights with rest, and her years with prosperity. <br><br>
                Thank You for making her the amazing person she is kind, loving, and strong. I pray that our love continues to grow deeper and that You guide us as we build a future together. May we always support and cherish each other, keeping You at the center of our relationship. <br><br>
                Thank You, Lord, for blessing me with her presence in my life. I pray for a year filled with countless blessings, unforgettable moments, and the fulfillment of every good desire in her heart. <br><br>
                In Jesus' name, I pray. Amen. <hr/>
